# Umbrella Weather App

## Description
The challenge was to design and develop a weather dashboard web application powered by OpenWeatherMap APIs. It uses geolocation to display the user's local weather conditions and a five day forecast. Umbrella allows users to search weather data by city, and it saves the user's searched locations in local storage. The app has a fun user interface, and it reminds the user to pack an umbrella when it's raining. My stragegy for this project was to have fun, and to try to create a weather app that is unique.

## Usage

In order to use the Umbrella app, allow location access to view local weather, or use the search bar to look up weather by city.
